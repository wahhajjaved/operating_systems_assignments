<h2 id="provided">Provided Files</h2>
<p>
There is one file provided for this lab (<code>vfifofum.c</code>), plus much 
inspiration from the following website:
<a href = "https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#character-device-drivers">
  https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#character-device-drivers </a>. Pay
  particular attention to the examples given in Chapter 4 and Chapter 6
  that model what needs to be done for this lab. Modification of the
  sample code will be sufficient, but that means you need to
  understand what that code is doing in read/write/open/release.
</p>

<p>
You <b>may</b> work in groups of at most 2 students. Each student must supply
their own solution.
</p>


<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
In this lab, you will write a device driver for a simple virtual
device: a pipe. This device will be incorporated into your Virtual Box
VM kernel via a loadable kernel module.
</p>

<p>
To review the ideas behind device drivers, consider the following:

<ul>
<li>Devices may use polling or interrupts.</li>
<li>Block devices buffer entire blocks in memory, whereas character
  devices transfer files one byte at a time to the operating
  system.</li>
<li>A strategy in Linux is to defer instantiating drivers from kernel
  compile time and/or system boot time until they are used. You saw
  some of this in Lab 1, where you could configure some parts of the
  kernel to be <code>&ltM&gt</code>, which meant run-time loadable.</li>
<li>All devices have major and minor device numbers, which are then
  registered in the <code>/dev</code> file system by <code>mknod</code>. </li>
<li> Each device driver provides a <code>file_operations</code> structure
  that contains function pointers for the appropriate operations.</li>


</ul>
</p>

<p>
In addition, devices must be initialized by a
function <code>foo_init</code> for device type <code>foo</code>. In
there, the device will have to be registered using
the <code>register_chrdev</code> function. When no longer needed a
device can be unregistered. This is described in the section on
unregistering a device, which will not be repeated here. Example code
can be used as inspiration.


</p>

<p>To make a loadable kernel module, the associated web page
  previously mentioned indicates how to do this
  with  <code>insmod</code> and <code>rmmod</code>, as well
  as <code>init_module</code> and <code>cleanup_module</code>. The
  website has more modern ways of doing things that can be investigated.

</p>

<p>Your task is the following:
    
<ul>
<li>Design and implement a character device driver for a virtual FIFO
  device. This is equivalent to a pipe. Your driver should
  implement <i>N</i> FIFO queues by implementing <i>2N</i> minor
  device numbers. Even number devices are write-only devices and
  odd-numbered are read-only devices. Characters written to
  device <i>i</i> are readable from device <i>i</i> +1.
  Start from your VM that was created in Lab 1. For the basic
  operation of the device, let N=1. For bonus credit, handle multiple
  FIFOs. Since this is like a pipe, each device needs 2 minor numbers,
  one for reading and one for writing.
  </li>

<li>Use <code>mknod</code> to create a special file with the
  name <code>/dev/fifoLK</code>, where L is a number between 100 and
  255, and K is the minor device number (starting at 0).
</li>

<li>Reading from an empty FIFO should return an EOF if the other end
  is not currently open.</li>
<li>If there is no data to be read, then the <code>read</code>
  operation should return 0.</li>
<li>If there is no space in the FIFO buffer, the <code>write</code> operation
  should return the number of characters that it was able to
  write.</li>
<li>Choose some fixed buffer size that is reasonable for this type of
  communication. Any buffer structure is OK, but Linux ring buffers
  may be an appropriate choice. See 
  <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/circular-buffers.html">Circular
    buffers</a>.
</li>
<li>In order to get data from/into the kernel into/from user space, the
  functions <code>get_user</code> and <code>put_user</code>.
</ul>

<p>Note: This is a variant of the producer-consumer problem at the
  kernel level. The code in the previous web page indicates what the
  reader and the writer should be doing.
</p>

<p> The functions that are required for the device are the
  following: <code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>read</code>,
  and <code>write</code>. Use the directions given in the first
  website on creating character device drivers.
</p>

<p>Finally, write a program to test your pipe device. One process
  writes stuff to the pipe and the second reads from the pipe. As
  bonus, implement an actual producer-consumer program that utilizes
  these devices by having the producer access an even-numbered device
  and the consumer access the corresponding odd-numbered device. Start
  with a simple program that reads/writes from the pipe, just sending
  bytes across the pipe that are read from stdin.
