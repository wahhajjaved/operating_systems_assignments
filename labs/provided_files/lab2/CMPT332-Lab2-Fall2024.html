    Lab 2: more gdb, more git, intro to xv6, and Project management<br>
</h1>

<b>Instructor:</b> Dwight Makaroff <br>
<b>Out: </b>September 16, 2024<br>
<b>Due: </b>9:00 p.m.  Thursday, September 19, 2024 (final deadline). <br>
<b>TOTAL MARKS: 6</b>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>
    You will use a Linux machine in <code>bash</code> for this
    lab.
</p>

<h2>Lab Description</h2>

<h2 id="xv6"><code>xv6</code></h2>
<p>To build and debug xv6, we need to use the compiler and debugger for riscv.
    The department has pre-built the toolchain. To build xv6, we will need to use
    the toolchain compiler to cross-compile xv6. </p>
  
<p>    Steps to install and run xv6:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Import xv6 git repo into your group repo (<b>WARNING</b>: only one of the
    group members should complete this step).<br><br>
      You can find the repository at <br>
    https://git.cs.usask.ca/cmpt332/xv6-fall2024.git or <br>
    git@git.cs.usask.ca:cmpt332/xv6-fall2024.git <br>
    <br>
    Depending on your current git repo set up, use one of the previous git
    links in the following command(s):
    <br>
    <br>

    <b><code>
        git clone https://git.cs.usask.ca/cmpt332/cmpt-332-fall-2024/cmpt332-2024-groupXX.git <br>
        cd cmpt332-2024-groupXX <br>
        git remote add xv6-origin https://git.cs.usask.ca/cmpt332/xv6-fall2024.git <br>
	      git fetch xv6-origin <br>
        git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories
xv6-origin/main <br>
        git read-tree --prefix=xv6/ -u xv6-origin/main <br>
        git commit -m "add xv6" <br>
        git push <br>
    </code></b>
    <br>

    <b> NOTE </b>: <i> cloning your group respository is only necessary if you
      haven't done so already </i> <br> <br>

    This will merge our xv6 repository's history to your group repository
    history. Now you have your own private copy of xv6 inside your group
    repo.
    <br><br>

  </li>
  <li><code>cd</code> to your local copy of xv6</li>
  <li><code>make qemu</code> will run xv6 in qemu,<br>
  </li><li><code>ctrl+a</code> release, then press <code>x</code> to exit from xv6,
         in otherwords: <code>(ctrl+a)+x</code>.
</li></ul>
<p> Take a screenshot of xv6 running and save it as <code>xv6-qemu.png</code>.</p>


<h2 id="resources">System Call Reference Material</h2>
Please read through 
<a href="https://timothya.com/learning/xv6-book/#chapter-4-traps--system-calls">
    this reference on xv6 system calls</a> in your own time, and come to the lab 
    or helpdesk with any questions you have. Reading will not be graded, however, 
    it will help you with understanding and completing Assignment 1 - Part D.

<h2> Part A: GDB Enhanced</h2>
</p>
<i>A handy resource for GDB is this GDB reference card: <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf" target="_blank">http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf</a></i></br>
<p>
There is 1 executable file, <code>program</code>,   that you can
compile through the provided Makefile 
(<code>student.makefile</code>, modify as you need to), and its
associated source file,  
<code>program.c</code>
    Please have a look through them.

<p>
This code is "silently buggy" in that it executes without any error on
the tuxworld machines, despite performing
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer
    overflow</a>. We will use GDB to debug this code. 

<ul>
    <li>Start GDB by typing <code>gdb ./program</code>

    <li>From here, create a breakpoint at line 39, using <code>break
        39</code>.  Run the program to the breakpoint by typing <code>run</code>. </li> 

    <li>Display the local variables where the code breaks, using <code>info locals</code>. 
        Copy/Paste these results to <b>lab2-gdbout.txt</b> under the header A1. </li>

    <li>Note the array size and the starting addresses of the "numbers" and
        "heapNeighbour" arrays. Use the command: <code>print numbers + (arrSize-1) </code> 
        to get the end address of the "numbers" array. Do either of iPtr1 or
        iPtr2 access outside of this array (are they smaller than numbers or larger
        than <code>numbers + (arrSize-1)</code>? If so, write which one in the file
        <b>lab2-gdbout.txt</b> under A2</b>.
</ul>

<b>Hint:</b> if you have trouble comparing hexadecimal values, cast the values
to int using "(int)". For example: 
    <blockquote><code>(int)(numbers + (arrSize-1))</code></blockquote>

<p> Set a breakpoint on the line of the code where you think the program is
    accessing memory outside of array bounds. Make the breakpoint conditional
    on an expression, using 
    <blockquote><code>breakpoint &lt;line-#&gt; if &lt;conditional-expr&gt;</code></blockquote>

This will cause gdb to run until the conditional expression is met. Choose an 
expression so that GDB stops when there is an out-of-bounds memory access. </p>

An example of a conditional breakpoint might be:
    <blockquote><code>break foo.c:7 if bar &gt; bat</code></blockquote>
which would create a breakpoint in the file foo.c at line 7. Here, GDB would 
stop when the variable bar is greater than bat. <br>

<ul>
    <li> Run the code. If GDB stops at your breakpoint, paste the local variables into
    <b>lab2-gdbout.txt</b> under A3</b>. If GDB runs to the end of the program, 
    then your conditional expression was never met. Talk to a TA to see if you are 
    on the right track.</li> 

    <li> One of the pointers will be pointing into the "heapNeighbour" array.
    print the value being pointed to by the pointer. Print the address of the 
    affected index of the "heapNeighbour" array as well. Paste these values into 
    <b>lab2-gdbout.txt</b> under A4. <br><b>NOTE</b>: <i>You may have to advance through
    the code line-by-line using </i><code> next </code> <i>until the overflow
    actually occurs, depending on where your breakpoint is set.</i></li>
</ul>

<b>Hint:</b> print array contents using <code>print *array@length</code><br>
<b>Hint:</b> variables can be referenced and dereferenced just like in C!<br>

<h2 id="xv6">Part B: Debugging xv6</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup Environment</h3>
<p>Steps to setup qemu-gdb to run on tuxworld:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Open two terminals and navigate both to your xv6
    directory. Alternatively, use tmux to setup two windows.</li>
    <li> Build and run xv6 in by entering the following commands:<br/><br/>
        Terminal 1:<blockquote>
            <code>make qemu-gdb</code><br/><br/>
            Note the socket address. It looks something like
            tcp::&lt;port&gt;. This shows that there are actually two
            processes running and that they need to talk to each other.
        </blockquote><br/>
        Terminal 2: <blockquote>
            <code> /student/cmpt332/xv6-2024/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gdb
                kernel/kernel<br/><br/>continue</code><br><br>
                       <br>
            You may want to export the path to the riscv gdb debugger to an
            environment variable, or create a handy script to avoid typing that
            entire path to gdb every time.
            </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li> You will likely see an error message in the GDB startup log: 
      <blockquote><code>
        warning: File "/student/NSID/path/to/xv6/.gdbinit" auto-loading has been <br/>
        declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to<br/>
        "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".<br/>
        To enable execution of this file add<br/>
        add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/xv6/.gdbinit<br/>
        line to your configuration file "/student/NSID/.gdbinit".</code> <br><br>
        <i>We have found that skipping the filename works better. That is "/path/to/xv6".</i> 
      </blockquote></li>
      <li> Follow these instructions, editing or creating the file
      .gdbinit in your home directory. Add the line <code>
      add-auto-load-safe-path </code> followed by the path to your xv6
      directory.</li>  
</ul>
<h3 id="breakXv6">Break xv6</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Exit GDB by typing <code>quit</code> and qemu-gdb by typing (<code>(ctrl+a)+x</code>). Open the file ./kernel/proc.c.</li>
    <li> Navigate to line 323 (in Vim, this can be done using <code>:323</code>, from command mode). This should take you to the second-to-last line in the fork function. </li>
    <li> Comment out the line: <code>release(&amp;np->lock);</code>
		<li> Rebuild and run using <code>make qemu-gdb</code>
</ul>
<h3 id="panic">Don't Panic!</h3>
At this point, both your terminal 1 and terminal 2 should hang. This is because the kernel has "panicked". You will see an error message:

<blockquote><code>panic: acquire</code></blockquote>

Use <code>ctrl-c</code> within gdb to halt the kernel and inspect the state of the program.

<h3 id="bt">Backtrace</h3>
<ul>
	<li> use <code>backtrace</code> to inspect the stack frames.</li>
	<li> use <code>backtrace full</code> and take notice of the additional information. These commands will be very helpful when debugging your code.</li>
    <li> open TUI mode with <code>(ctrl+x)+a</code> (you can also open this by typing <code>layout src</code> ).</li>
	<li> use <code>frame 2</code> to navigate to the second stack frame. Notice how the TUI view shows you the line of code that corresponds to the stack frame you specify.</li>

	<li> copy the file, line-number, and code contents of frame 2 to <b>lab2-gdbout.txt</b>
 under the header B1. Use the following format:
		<blockquote>&lt;file-name&gt;:&lt;line-number&gt; &lt;code&gt;</blockquote></li>
	<li> to view an item in the process table run: <code>print proc[0]</code> (where the integer is the index in the array)</li>
	<li> if you aren't sure what each fields are in this proc struct, we can easily find out by entering: <code>ptype proc</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bt">Fix it</h3>
Make sure to undo your change to proc.c:323 before you quit!



<h2 id="grpMgmt">Part C: Group Management Skills</h2>
<p> The truth is not many students like group work, however, in industry you're
    guaranteed to be working on a team, thus it is an extremely valuable skill
    to have that employers look for. </p>
<p> When working in a group it's important to set clear expectations with your
    partner of what you both want to get out of the course. It is often
    recommended that you have scheduled a regular meeting time (yes, even for
    groups of two) as this can help you sync with your partner and talk about
    progress/procrastination that has been made.
    <i>The above is not required of you but it will help you succeed in 
    communicating with your partner, who you may or may not have previously been    
    acquainted, for this class and any future group work.</i>
</p>
<p> Dividing work for multiple people is a skill that takes practice and is
    often aided with the use of a task board. There are many programs out there
    that you can use as a task board, I'd recommend
    <a href="https://bubbl.us/">bubbl</a>, or something similar. Bubbl allows you
    to create tasks that can be completed in parallel along with mapping task
    dependencies, <i>task b requires the function from task a to completed
    beforehand</i>. See <code>Chat.png</code> as an example.
    In your case, the Design Document you will have to create will be
    helpful when assigning work.
</p>
<p> Create a simple task tree with a minimum of two tasks that can be done in
    parallel where each of those nodes has at least two children. This doesn't
    have to be limited to computer science jobs, it can be something like
    cleaning the house, baking, yard work, etc. Download it as a PNG file and
    save it as <code>tasks.png</code>. </p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p> A single tar file containing your <code>xv6-qemu.png</code>, 
<code>lab2-gdbout.txt</code>,
  <code>tasks.png</code>
    and <code>git-log.txt</code>. </p>
