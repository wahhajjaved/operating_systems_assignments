<h2 id="docs">Useful Documentation</h2>

<h2 id="provided">Provided Files</h2>
<p>
There is only 1 provided file for this lab <code>sim.c</code>. This contains
a scheduling simulator built on UBC pthreads (inspired by xv6).
You <b>may</b> work in groups of at most 4 students.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
In this lab, you will be implementing a round robin scheduler with 5 priorities
using using multiple queues. It is possible to use a heap, but you are
encouraged to use your list library from assignment 1 for the queues.
</p>

<p>
Inside <code>set_state()</code> add processes that are being set to
<code>RUNNABLE</code> to the queue based on their priority.
The priority of a process is inside its process table entry.

Reimplement <code>next_proc()</code> to return the highest priority runnable
process. Treat priority like POSIX does, i.e. a process with a lower priority
number has "highest priority".
</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables and Grading</h2>
<p>
A single tar file named <code>lab5.tar</code> containing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Makefile</code> (1 mark)</li>
  <li><code>sim.c</code> (1 mark) modified to run the highest priority 
	  process.</li>
  <li><code>output.txt</code> (1 mark) log of the output of the simulator.</li>
  <li><code>gitlog.txt</code> (1 mark)</li>
  <li>Any other necessary source code for compilation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
GENERAL: Ensure that your name, NSID, and student number are at the beginning
of every file that you hand in.  <b>If a lab is group work</b>, all partners'
information is required in EVERY FILE. No files with lines more than 80
characters.
