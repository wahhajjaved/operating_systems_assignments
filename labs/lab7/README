I didn't do lab 3 on time so I am handing that in late.
I messed up my submission for lab 6, and handed it in to the lab 3 assignment
on canvas. Since there is only one attempt per submission, I can't submit
lab 3 on its own canvas page. I got permission from the professor to bundle
it with lab 7 and submit both to the lab 7 canvas page.
