- <src_port> <dest_hostname> <dest_port>
- Ports must be between 30001 and 40000


[ Threads ]
- 5 threads are needed:
	-- Thread 1 handles keyboard input from console
	-- Thread 2 handles output to console
	-- Thread 3 listens for UDP datagrams
	-- Thread 4 sends UDP datagrams
	-- Thread 5 is the server which coordinates sending of messages
	
	
[ Console Input ]
	- Strings are read from the console and do not need to be parsed
	- Console input is handled using fgets()
	- Each string can be a max of 1000 chars
	- fgets() will return newlines but these are not stripped as the output
		on clients should match the input on the server
	- Each input string is placed in a list so the messages can be buffered
