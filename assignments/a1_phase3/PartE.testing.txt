PART E testing

for testing, we will run the same commands as the assignmnet description

steps for running the test
    1.navigate to xv6 folder
    2. make and run the xv6
        make
        make qemu
    3. then excecute the commands
            trace 32 grep hello README
            trace 2147483647 grep hello README
            grep hello README
            trace 2 usertests forkforkfork
