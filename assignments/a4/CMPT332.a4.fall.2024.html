<h1> Computer Science 332 FALL 2024</h1>
<h2> Assignment #4</h2>
<h3> Date: November 20th, 2024</h3>
<h3> Due: December 5, 2024 18:00:00 CST</h3>
<hr> <br>

<h2> Total Marks: 90</h2>

Part A (option 1, 2, or 3) is required along with Part B.

<h2> PART A (option 1): File Systems Simulation/Experimentation (65 marks)</h2>

<h2> PART A.1 (option 1): File Systems Simulation (40 marks)</h2>
<p>
For this assignment you are going to implement a File System
simulation using UBC Pthreads or RT Threads. You will need to implement a subset of
the file operations discussed in class.
You will also need to use the monitor solution from Assignment 2 or Lab 4.

 <p>
 This will require 2 new C files: filesys-sim-monitor.c (which you can
 base your code off of reader-writer-monitor.c) and filesys-sim-threads.c. 

<p>What is required of the simulation:

<ul>
<li>Disk superblock. You will need to manage free space and have
  locations of the root directory at a minimum in the superblock. Free
  space can be managed by techniques discussed in class.

<li>
File operations to
  implement: <tt>mkdir</tt>, <tt>cd</tt>, <tt>open</tt>, <tt>close</tt>, 
<tt>read</tt>,  <tt>write</tt>, <tt>seek</tt>, <tt>rm</tt>
  and <tt>rmdir</tt>.
<br>
  These operations must have mutually 
  exclusive access to the file system whenever they modify actual disk
  contents.  The file open operation will have a mode that allows a
  file to be created if it doesn't exist. Each operation should fail
  gracefully. You need not handle every error condition, but clearly
  state which ones you are going to handle and why.
<li>
How does the simulation proceed? The simulation will have a number of
threads that execute file operations, in a pseudo-random fashion. They
should perform an operation, sleep for a while and then perform
another file operation. A thread can only read and write from files
that are opened, but if another thread has created and written to a
file, subsequently any thread can operate on the file.
<li>
Concurrency issues. All operations except read and seek modify the
disk, either an inode or a superblock. Thus they must be protected by
putting them in the monitor. Modifying the disk for creating/deleting files and
directories must be done simply in a mutually exclusive manner. For
reading and writing, you will need to implement the readers/writers
problem to allow multiple threads to have a file open for reading, but
only one thread to have it open for writing. Thus, EACH FILE will need
a pair condition variables in the monitor: OKTOREAD and OKTOWRITE. These had
previously been defined these as integers, which is still the case,
just that now each pair of integers refers to the CVs for a file
(e.g. 0/1 refer to file 0, 2/3 refer to file 1). See the next
paragraph for clarification on the exact meaning of file numbers. 

</ul>

Other restrictions/assumptions that you must make in order to have 
the problem be tractable.

<ul>
<li>
The disk will be a fixed number of blocks. These blocks can be
allocated amongst the 3 types of blocks in a fixed or dynamic fashion.
<li>
An entire directory's contents can be held in a single disk block.
<li>
Files can be referred to by NUMBER as well as name. This is a little
weird, but makes the simulation much easier. There can be a maximum
fixed number of files in the system, implying that you need 2*numFiles
condition variables in your monitor implementation. 
This is something you can configure in the header file of the file-system
source files, but also in the monitor itself. You must do this separately,
because we don't want to have the monitor code explicitly rely on something
from an application.
<li>
To facilitate this, I suggest a modification to the way open is
implemented. Creating a file is done by opening a file with the Create
mode bit set. As well, read, write, or read/write modes can also be
set. That is normal. What is not normal is that the return code from
Create will be the file number of the file in the entire system, not
just the file descriptor for the current thread. If Create fails, it
should return -1 and set a global ERRNO value.


</ul>

<h2> PART A.2 (option 1): Performance Experimentation (25 marks)</h2>

<p>
How will this be judged? In addition to the code and
testing to show that the code actually works, we want to see from you a 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">report</span> that shows and 
discusses the results of a set of experiments that compare the
performance of the system under different configurations. You'll have
to use the same seed for 
the random number generation in order to get a valid comparison
between runs with different parameters. The choice of seed may greatly
affect your results, so a number of experiments will need to be
performed, and some statistical methods used to get averages, standard
deviations, etc. from your measurements.<br> 


<p>
For this part, you will perform some experiments on your file
system. The most basic performance experiment will select a single
parameter (keeping all other possible parameters constant) and
measuring a single performance measure. This is to be somewhat
open-ended and you can select metrics according to your interest.

 <p>
You must compare some performance statistics on the virtual disk and
filesystem you have created. The most obvious statistic would be the
amount of conflict between threads when reading and writing.

<p>
Other aspects of the file system simulation may be varied as
parameters in your experiments and you can choose which components
will be hard coded and which will be able to be changed during the
experiments. Parameters should be input via one of three methods: a)
configuration file, b) command-line, or c) environment
variables. It doesn't matter which method is used.

<p>
What components can be varied? Here are a number of suggestions, by no
means exhaustive: 1) size of disk, 2) number of threads, 3) average
read size, 4) number of files, 5) average time between file system
requests (sleep time).

<h2>PART A (option 2): Page Replacement Simulation/Experiementation (65 marks)</h2>

<h2>PART A.1 (option 2): Page Replacement Simulation   (40 marks)</h2>

<p>
This version of the assignment requires you to simulate page
references using RT Threads and your monitor from A2 or Lab 4 (other aspects
can be implemented using ideas from Lab 7).

<p>Page references are of the form <code>read(address, size)</code>
and <code>write(address, size)</code>. The size is the number
of <code>words</code> that are referenced by the operation. An example
is read(0x456000, 5). This will translate into 5 <code>read</code>
operations of 1 word each.

<p>
Program reference string (10 marks): You can make similar assumptions to lab
7. The address, however, is 
given in terms of the virtual address of the program, and must be
converted to the page number. You should endeavour to make the
reference string of the program somewhat realistic. Thus, it will not
conform to a uniform distribution, but something more like a Zipf
distribution that references addresses in the code segment, data
segment and heap in some realistic fashion.

<p>
Page Replacement Algorithms (20 marks): Implement two algorithms for
page replacement (Clock and Second Chance). Run the simulation for a
given amount of physical memory and pre-determined page size. On each
reference, the algorithm must determine whether a reference is to 
a page currently resident or if a page fault has occurred. If a page
fault has occurred, a victim must be chosen and the proper memory
allocation data structure updated.

<p>
Paging Behaviour of Multiple Program Execution (10 marks): 
Simulate multiple programs running at the same time. This would be
done by having multiple threads executing different reference strings,
with alternating random sleep times between accesses (call RttSleep()).




<h2>PART A.2 (option 2): Page Replacement Performance Experimentation (25 marks)</h2>

<p>
How will this be judged? In addition to the code and
testing to show that the code actually works, we want to see from you a 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">report</span> that shows and 
discusses the results of a set of experiments that compare the
performance of the system under different configurations. You'll have
to use the same seed for 
the random number generation in order to get a valid comparison
between runs with different parameters. The choice of seed may greatly
affect your results, so a number of experiments will need to be
performed, and some statistical methods used to get averages, standard
deviations, etc. from your measurements.<br> 

<p>
Similar to Part A2, design a set of experiments to compare the
performance of the 2 algorithms on the same reference strings. Define
performance measures that you think are of interest and report them at
the end of the simulation. At a minimum, the Page Fault Rate would be
the most important thing to measure, but there are more that you could
imagine. Choose parameters that may affect the performance as
well. Three required parameters are a) Program virtual memory size, b)
page size, and c) physical memory size.



<h2>PART A (option 3): Contiguous Memory Management Simulation/Experiment (65 marks)</h2>

<h2>PART A.1 (option 3): Contiguous Memory Management Simulation (40 marks)</h2>

<p><br>
For this version assignment you are going to implement a memory management
simulation. It will be a solution to the
general dynamic storage allocation problem. That is, you are going to
provide the interface routines <span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">MyMalloc()</span> </span>and <span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">MyFree()</span>
within the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RT Threads</span> environment
using your Monitor solution from A2 or Lab 4.
These should have additional parameters and the same return types as
  malloc() and free() as described in the UNIX man pages, but slightly
  different semantics.&nbsp;   These two routines will take an
  additional argument (an identifier of the algorithm to be used to
  find available memory). <code>MyMalloc()</code> is equivalent
  to <code>BF_Allocate()</code>  from Lab 6.

 Finally, you will need a procedure to show the memory allocation
and number of operations performed (in some fashion) at any point in
time. (<span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight:
 bold;">MyMemStats()</span>).
<span  style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight:
 bold;">MyMemStats()</span> takes 3 parameters:
an integer which identifies which algorithm you want the statistics for, an
integer stating what type of statistic you want, and a void *pointer
to a data structure that will contain the stats. Use your creativity
to think of things that will be important to measure. Recall in class
 that we discussed several methods for quantifying fragmentation.

<p>
As far as algorithms go, I'd like you to choose two (2) algorithms
discussed in class for contiguous memory allocation and compare their
performance in terms of efficiency, fragmentation and the
ability to allocate the requested memory sizes. You may also use your
creativity and come up with an efficient and elegant algorithm for
bonus credit of up to 10% of the marks assigned for this part. One
algorithm must be either FF, BF, WF, NF or the
<a href =  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation">
Buddy System</a>; the other can be of your own
choosing. When a request to <code>MyMalloc()</code> is made, your
structure will 
need to be searched to find an address to return to the caller, and
the data structure modified to indicate the new state of the memory
system. When a request to MyFree() is made, the address must be
inserted into the data structure of available positions and
neighbouring locations must be coalesced (if appropriate). <br>
<p>
If you choose your own algorithm, once you start to think about it, you
will find that this is primarily a data structure problem. The key to
efficiency will be the data structure you choose. Be creative in your
use of data structures to make allocation and freeing very
efficient. Try to get as close to O(1) for allocating and freeing as
possible. If this means an extra list or other data structure, think
about the extra storage cost and justify your decisions.

&nbsp;<br>
There are some restrictions on this simulation.

<ol type="I">
<li>Assume a fixed size memory. It should be something reasonable for
  a modern computer.
<li>
Semantics of MyMalloc() and MyFree(). If a thread requests an amount of
memory that is unavailable, the thread should block/wait until that memory
becomes available (that would be waiting on a condition variable in the
monitor (e.g. FFMemAvail or something like that)). MyFree() must only coalesce
memory spaces that are physically adjacent with respect to the semantics of
the algorithm being used.
<li>
Implement the memory requesting processes as threads, which are in
an continuous loop of freeing and allocating memory according to some
distribution of memory request sizes and request inter-arrival times up until
a desired maximum number of times (command-line argument).
For example, you could have one thread
request 10KB once a second (that would be constant size and constant
time interval), and also periodically frees those requests that have
been accommodated.
That's pretty boring, so use randomly generated numbers in some
interesting way to generate a set of requests. For free()ing the
memory, in each iteration of the loop, randomly select a pointer to
free with a random probability of selecting no thread at all to
free. For a while, memory usage will build up, but once all the
requests have been made, memory usage will reduce down to zero.

<br>
Requests rarely conform to a uniform or normal distribution.
Common distributions observed in computer system resource access
include the poisson, exponential, pareto, erlang, student's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span> and Chi-square distributions. For
this assignment, the inter-arrival time can be modeled with an
exponential distribution, and the memory size with a normal
distribution. We're not going to deal with completely accurate models for
request sizes. See the Appendix for a method for calculating random
numbers from such a distribution.<br><i>You do not need an in-depth
understanding of statistics to do this assignment. If you have any
questions on the statistics part of it, just ask an instructor or a TA.</i>
</p>
<li>
One suggestion is to simulate both algorithms simultaneously.
That means you will
have <i>k</i> threads for each algorithm. To keep track of allocations
and free space, there will need to be
an appropriate data structure for each algorithm in which to simulate
the allocations (each algorithm assumes a separate memory space), as
well as a set of data structures for the statistics.
In order for the algorithms to be
comparable, the same pseudo-random number sequence must be used. In
mainp(), you will have to generate a sequence of random numbers for
the allocation sizes and times and pass that to each thread for its
use in the simulation.
</ol>


<h2>PART A.2 (option 3): Contiguous Memory Management Performance Experimentation (25 marks)</h2>

<p>
How will this assignment be judged? In addition to the code and
testing to show that the code actually works, we want to see from you a 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">report</span> that shows and 
discusses the results of a set of experiments that compare the
performance of the system under different configurations. You'll have
to use the same seed for 
the random number generation in order to get a valid comparison
between runs with different parameters. The choice of seed may greatly
affect your results, so a number of experiments will need to be
performed, and some statistical methods used to get averages, standard
deviations, etc. from your measurements.<br> 
<p>
Experiments to be run (you are free to add your own for bonus credit):

<ul>
<li>Determine the effect of the number of threads on your algorithms,
  as it scales for 2 choices of number of threads per algorithm.
<li>Determine the effect on fragmentation that varying the number of
  allocations has on your algorithm performance. Range from 1000
  allocations per thread to 10000 per thread at 1000 operation increments
  The number of simulations you run will affect the precision
  in your results and the intelligence with which you can write your
  report.
</ul>

Minimum measurements to take (feel free to add your own for bonus credit):
<ul>
<li> total number of nodes searched to find a piece of memory/free a piece
  of memory as a cumulative total for the simulation for this
  algorithm.
<li> number of holes in memory at any given time
<li> one additional measure of fragmentation
</ul>

<p> The total number of bonus credit marks for this part is 20.
</p>

<h2>PART B: Big Files (25 marks)</h2>

<p>In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an xv6
file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks, or 268*BSIZE
bytes (BSIZE is 1024 in xv6). This limit comes from the fact that an
xv6 inode contains 12 "direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect"
block number, which refers to a block that holds up to 256 more block
  numbers, for a total of 12+256=268 blocks.

<p>The <tt>bigfile</tt> command creates the longest file it can,
and reports that size:
<pre>
$ bigfile
..
wrote 268 blocks
bigfile: file is too small
$
</pre>
The test fails because the longest file is only 268 blocks.

<p>You'll change the xv6 file system code to support a
"doubly-indirect" block in each inode, containing 256 addresses of
singly-indirect blocks, each of which can contain up to 256 addresses
of data blocks. The result will be that a file will be able to consist
of up to 256*256+256+11 blocks (11 instead of 12, because we will
sacrifice one of the direct block numbers for the double-indirect
block).

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

<p><tt>mkfs</tt> initializes the file system to have fewer than 2000
free data blocks, too few to show off the changes you'll
make. Modify <tt>kernel/param.h</tt> to change <tt>FSSIZE</tt> 
from 2000 to 200,000:
<pre>
    #define FSSIZE       200000  /* size of file system in blocks */
</pre>

<p>Rebuild <tt>mkfs</tt> so that is produces a bigger disk:
<kbd>$ rm mkfs/mkfs fs.img; make mkfs/mkfs</kbd>

<h3>What to Look At</h3>

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by <tt>struct dinode</tt>
in <tt>fs.h</tt>. You're particularly interested in <tt>NDIRECT</tt>,
<tt>NINDIRECT</tt>, <tt>MAXFILE</tt>, and the <tt>addrs[]</tt> element
of <tt>struct dinode</tt>. Look at Figure 8.3 in the xv6 text for a
diagram of the standard xv6 inode.

<p>
The code that finds a file's data on disk is in <tt>bmap()</tt>
in <tt>fs.c</tt>. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. <tt>bmap()</tt> is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, <tt>bmap()</tt> allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

<p>
<tt>bmap()</tt> deals with two kinds of block numbers. The <tt>bn</tt>
argument is a "logical block number" -- a block number within the file,
relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, and the
argument to <tt>bread()</tt>, are disk block numbers.
You can view <tt>bmap()</tt> as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

<h3>Your Job</h3>

<div class="required">
Modify <tt>bmap()</tt> so that it implements a doubly-indirect block,
in addition to direct blocks and a singly-indirect block.  You'll have
to have only 11 direct blocks, rather than 12, to make room for your
new doubly-indirect block; you're not allowed to change the size of an
on-disk inode.  The first 11 elements of <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt> should
be direct blocks; the 12th should be a singly-indirect block (just
like the current one); the 13th should be your new doubly-indirect
block. You are done with this exercise when <tt>bigfile</tt> writes
65803 blocks and <tt>usertests</tt> runs successfully:
</div>

<pre>
$ bigfile
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 65803 blocks
done; ok
$ usertests
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
</pre>

<p>
<tt>bigfile</tt> will take at least a minute and a half to run.

<p>Hints:

<ul>
    
<li> Make sure you understand <tt>bmap()</tt>. Write out a diagram of the
relationships between <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, the indirect block, the
doubly-indirect block and the singly-indirect blocks it points to, and
data blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a doubly-indirect
block increases the maximum file size by 256*256 blocks (really -1,
since you have to decrease the number of direct blocks by one).

<li>
Think about how you'll index the doubly-indirect block, and
the indirect blocks it points to, with the logical block
number.

<li>If you change the definition of <tt>NDIRECT</tt>, you'll
probably have to change the declaration of <tt>addrs[]</tt>
in <tt>struct inode</tt> in <tt>file.h</tt>. Make sure that
<tt>struct inode</tt> and <tt>struct dinode</tt> have the
same number of elements in their <tt>addrs[]</tt> arrays.

<li>If you change the definition of <tt>NDIRECT</tt>, make sure to create a
new <tt>fs.img</tt>, since <tt>mkfs</tt> uses <tt>NDIRECT</tt> to build the
file system.  

<li>If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps by crashing,
delete <tt>fs.img</tt> (do this from Unix, not xv6).  <tt>make</tt> will build a
new clean file system image for you.

<li>Don't forget to <tt>brelse()</tt> each block that you
<tt>bread()</tt>.

<li>You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
  blocks only as needed, like the original <tt>bmap()</tt>.

<li>Make sure <tt>itrunc</tt> frees all blocks of a file, including
  double-indirect blocks.

</ul>

<p>BONUS (5 marks): support triple-indirect blocks.
