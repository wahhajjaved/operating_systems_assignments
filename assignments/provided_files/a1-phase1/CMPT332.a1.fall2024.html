<b>Out: </b>September 10, 2024<br>
<b>Due:</b> <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Phase 1 Milestone: 9:00 AM, September 16, 2024<br>
Phase 2 Milestone: 9:00 AM, September 23, 2024  <br>
Phase 3 Complete Assignment: 9:00 PM, October 2, 2024</div>
&nbsp;
<p>The first parts of this assignment are designed to get you back
  into the swing of 
things with respect to C and UNIX/Linux systems programming as well as
Linux/Windows threads programming. 

<ul>
<li>Be sure that
all your code compiles on <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
school's computers</span> using the gcc compiler in Linux/Windows as
appropriate. 
<li>All parts of
  this assignment may be done in teams of at most 2 students. 
<li>All C code must be written in plain C (conforming to the C90
  standard, in particular <b>-std=gnu90</b>, which is an enhancement  to C90,
  but does not go all the way to ALL C99 functions). Warnings must be set to
<b>-Wall -pedantic -Wextra</b>.
See details in the Lab for required compiler flags to
  ensure this functionality.
  
  <li>Points will be deducted when C++ constructs are used in the code in the 
early phases. Assignments will <b>not be accepted</b> for the final
    phase if they produce any warnings.
</ul>
 </p> 

<h2>TOTAL MARKS: 220</h2>

<h2> Part A: Parents, Children and Threads (55 marks)</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART A.1. (30 marks: 5 for Phase 1 and 5
  for Phase 2 and 20 for Phase 3)</span> Write a WINDOWS 
program that creates <i>multiple threads</i> that each perform the
  same function (compute squares of positive integers) in parallel
  until a <i>deadline</i>, <b>without synchronization</b> between the
  processes/threads of any kind. The number of child threads 
(threads) and the deadline (deadline) and the maximum integer (size) are to
be <i>command-line parameters</i>. Each thread does the 
same task. The task is given below which utilizes the third command-line
parameter (size). The usage is as follows: <tt>./partA1 threads deadline
  size</tt>.

<br>Parent thread functionality:
<ul>
  <li>The application should have a parent thread create M child threads.
  <li>The parent should then sleep until the deadline. 
     The simplest way to do this is to use the system call <b>Sleep</b>.
  <li>If the deadline occurs before all children complete, inform the child
	threads that they should exit. One possible strategy is if the
	deadline has passed, the parent sets a global variable named
	something like <b>keepRunning</b> to have the
	value <b>FALSE</b>. The child threads would read this variable
	each time Square() is called from the main loop of the thread
	that calls Square(). If you find some other way
	to do this, you may do so. Please document your solution carefully.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Once created, each child then executes a procedure to calculate
(but not print out) the squares of <b>each</b> of the
first <tt>numSquares</tt> positive integers in a loop
(i.e., 1<sup>2</sup>,
  2<sup>2</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup>,4<sup>2</sup>, 5<sup>2</sup>).
The restriction is that procedure Square()<sup></sup>
cannot use any multiplication operations (we want a simple operation
  that will take a <b>long</b> time to complete and <b>a lot</b> of
stack
space). Instead, use the following algorithm:</li>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">int Square(N)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; if (N == 0) return (0);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return (Square (N-1) + N + N - 1);<br>
}</div>
<br>
The square procedure must also count the number of times it is invoked.


<p>
An example invocation of this program is the following:
<tt> partA1 4 3 200</tt>. This creates 4 child threads,
and has each thread compute <tt>Square(1), Square(2), Square(3)</tt>
...  <tt>Square(200)</tt> with a deadline of 3 seconds from the
time the parent thread starts running. 
<p>
<p>
Upon exit, Each child should print the following:<br>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>elapsed real time since the child began.</li>
    <li>number of invocations of the Square() procedure by the current
    thread. You may not change the parameter list for
    Square(). One way to do that is to use a global array of counters,
    indexed by a parameter (threadId) passed to the thread upon
    creation. The parent and child threads then both have access to
    this counter.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
You will need to become familiar with the following Win32 System
calls: CreateThread(), GetSystemTime(), and Sleep().

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART A.2. (15 marks: 5 for Phase 2
  and 10 for Phase 3)</span> 
Repeat part A.1 in UBC pthreads. (Linux only) <br>
<ul>
  <li>The difference here is the syntax of the thread calls and
  the process communication. If the timer expires before children
  threads are finished, the parent should Kill() the children threads,
  instead of having them check the shared flag. In this case, the
  parent would be responsible for printing out the statistics for each
  child that had not finished executing when the deadline occurred. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART A.3. (10 marks)</span> 
Repeat part A.2 in Posix threads. (Linux only)<br>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference here is the syntax of the
  threads operations. You are free to exit the threads in any way. It
  is not expected to use pthread_join.<br>

  </li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PART A.4. <b>BONUS.</b> (15  marks)</span>&nbsp; 
Repeat part A.1 with UNIX processes. The way I want you to do this will
require the use of signals and signal handlers. When the timer expires,
the children should be signaled that this has happened and they should
catch the signal and exit appropriately.
You must write a signal handler to handle the SIGALRM signal.&nbsp;
You will need to create an additional process, the timer. When the timer
determines that the time to execute the program has expired, the timer
process should send a SIGALRM to each child and the parent, telling
them to stop. When the signal is caught by the child, it should print
out the required values (as in previous parts) and return an error status to the
parent. If the child terminates normally before the timer expires, it
should print out its values, state that it finished normally and
return a success status to the parent. The parent process should be in a
waitloop, waiting for each child to finish. If each child finishes,
then it should kill the timer and then terminate normally.

<p>
NOTE:
<p>
1) For all of these parts, reuse as much code as possible. In particular,
the calculation of Square must be in one C source file, and be able to
be compiled/linked in with any of the parts. Recall that the .o files and
executable files that you create will need to be distinguished from each other
for different Operating Systems (Linux, Windows, Mac) or hardware
architectures (Intel, ARM, POWER), so create your makefile with
care. <b>For A1, only Windows and Linux on Intel are required.</b>
<p>
2)
The marks for Part A will be equally allocated to coding style,
execution and testing. A complete description of your design is
required, but will receive a lower weighting. Finally, your use of git
and make will receive some consideration.

<p>
3) Phase 1 and 2 have 15 marks in total for Part A.

<br>
<h2>Part B: Shell script (10 marks - 5 Phase 1 and 5 Phase 3)</h2>
Write an interactive shell script that executes Parts A.1, A.2, A.3 or A.4
(bonus) according to the user's instructions. The shell script reads the
appropriate values from the user and then invokes the corresponding
program with the corresponding command line arguments. The structure
you use for this part of the program is up to you, but you must do
this in a loop until the user wishes to quit. Obviously, part A.1 only
works on Windows, so there should be a check to see that the user is
on the proper architecture for the program to be run.

<p>
A standard format for the interface is required. 
Therefore, please code your shell program to the following standard.

<pre>partB.bash version</pre>

where version is one of partA1, partA2, or partA3 (or partA4 for the bonus part).

<p>The input <b>must be able be redirected from a file</b> where each
  line in the input file is intended to contain three integers. You
  are also free to develop an interactive menu.
The marking script will use this syntax to check several input combinations
as follows:

<pre>partB.bash version < inputfile </pre>

This should allow a user to provide arguments to the program
interactively in a loop until the end of file is reached. Have the user input 
contain 3 integers on each line. NOTE: You should check for invalid input
in the bash script as well as in the C program (things like negative numbers,
strings, etc).

<p>Note: Phase 1 has 5 marks for Part B. Phase 3 has 5 marks for Part
  B. 
<b>Hand in this script for all 3 phases.</b>

<h2>Part C: List Library&nbsp; (85 marks - 5 for phase 1 and 10 for phase
  2 and 70 for phase 3 (Linux only))</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<p> Lists are composed of elements called <i>nodes</i> (NODE data
type).
Each node is able to hold one item. An item is any C data type that can
be pointed to - so your node structure should have a
(void *) field in it to reference the <b>item</b> held by that node. For the
purposes of this assignment, though, your code should allow a user to create 
several lists 
<b>WHERE EACH LIST HAS A HOMOGENOUS DATA TYPE</b>.<br> 


<p>The implementation of the library shall have <b>no dynamic memory
allocation on a per-list or per-node basis</b>. The standard way of
  doing this is to define two static memory blocks at compile time:
  one for LISTs and one for NODEs. These are separate data types and
  test code knows only about LISTs and items. It knows nothing about NODEs.
It is permissible to dynamically allocate a large chunk of memory for a 
collection of lists or nodes, but only one allocation at the beginning of the
program  execution. Any other uses of the malloc() function inside the
  library will result in an implementation grade of 0. Also
note that there is no ListInit() function, so you will have to find some way
to know when the first execution happens. Define a maximum number of LISTs and
a maximum number of NODEs and implement the library such that any LIST may have
between 0 and the maximum number of nodes at different points in time, but no 
more than the maximum number of nodes may be in use at any one point in time. 
Think of the array of NODEs as a pool that may be shared between the
lists. Over time, there can also be a different number of LISTs
actively being used.
</p>
<p>You must create the user-defined type LIST, implement
functions to manipulate lists, and compile the code to be used as a
library. An instance of type LIST refers to a particular list and will
be an argument to most of your list manipulation routines. </p>
<p> You are to implement the following list manipulation routines: </p>
<ol>
  <li><tt>LIST *ListCreate()</tt> makes a new, empty list, and returns
its reference on success. Returns a NULL pointer on failure. </li>
  <li><tt>int ListCount(list)</tt> returns the number of items in list.
  </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListFirst(list)</tt> returns a pointer to the first
item
in list and makes the first item the current item. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListLast(list)</tt> returns a pointer to the last item
in list and makes the last item the current one. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListNext(list)</tt> advances the list's current node by
one,
and returns a pointer to the new current item. If this operation
attempts to advances the current item beyond the end of the list, a
NULL
pointer is returned. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListPrev(list)</tt> backs up the list's current node by
one, and returns a pointer to the new current item. If this operation
attempts to back up the current item beyond the start of the list, a
NULL pointer is returned. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListCurr(list)</tt> returns a pointer to the current
item in list. </li>
  <li><tt>int ListAdd(list, item)</tt> adds the new item to list
directly after the current item, and makes the new item the current item. If
the current pointer is at the end of the list, the item is
added at the end. Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure. </li>
  <li><tt>int ListInsert(list, item)</tt> adds item to list directly
before the current item, and makes the new item the current one. If the
current pointer is at the start of the list, the item is added at the
start.&nbsp; Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure. </li>
  <li><tt>int ListAppend(list, item)</tt> adds item to the end of list,
and makes the new item the current one. Returns 0 on success, -1 on
failure. </li>
  <li><tt>int ListPrepend(list, item)</tt> adds item to the front of
list, and makes the new item the current one. Returns 0 on success, -1
on failure. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListRemove(list)</tt> Return current item and take it
out of list. Make the next item the current one. </li>
 <li><tt>void ListConcat(list1, list2)</tt> adds list2 to the end of
list1. The current pointer is set to the current pointer of list1.
List2 no longer exists after the operation. </li>
  <li><tt>void ListFree(list, itemFree)</tt> delete list. itemFree is a
pointer to a routine that frees an item. It should be invoked (within
ListFree) as: <tt>(*itemFree)(itemToBeFreed);</tt> </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListTrim(list)</tt> Return last item and take it out of
list. The current pointer shall be the new last item in the list. </li>
  <li><tt>void *ListSearch(list, comparator, comparisonArg)</tt>
searches list starting at the current item until the end is reached or
a match is found. In this context, a match is determined by the
comparator parameter. This parameter is a pointer to a routine that
takes as its first argument an item pointer, and as its second argument
comparisonArg. Comparator returns 0 if the item and comparisonArg don't
match (i.e. didn't find it), or 1 if they do (i.e. found it). Exactly
what constitutes a match is up to the implementor of comparator. If a
match is found, the current pointer is left at the matched item and the
pointer to that item is returned. If no match is found, the current
pointer is left at the end of the list and a NULL pointer is returned. </li>
</ol>
<p>Take special note of the fact that many of these routines are
mirrors of each other. ListPrepend is almost the same as ListAppend, so code
and debug in stages, so that you know you have parts of the program working
correctly from day one of starting to work on this assignment. Do not
leave testing and integration until the last days before the
  assignment is due. Do not add any other procedures in the entire
  implementation without checking with the instructor or TA. The
  requested procedures are the API (Application Programming Interface)
  to the list library. That means that you <b>may not call an API
  function from inside the API</b>.
<br>
</p>
Avoid traversing or searching the list whenever possible. It is
possible to avoid traversing/searching in every function, except of
course, ListSearch() (and ListFree()).<br>
<br>
<h3> Implementation Hints/Requirements</h3>
Your code for the solution for Part C must consist of (at least) six files: 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">list.h</span>, 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">list_adders.c</span>, 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">list_movers.c</span>,&nbsp; 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">list_removers.c</span>, 
<span  style="font-weight: bold;">mytestlist.c</span> and lines in the 
<span  style="font-weight: bold;">Makefile</span> to compile your test
program and the class test program. 

<p>
Note that there is no <i>separate</i> makefile for Part C. 
There is one makefile for the entire assignment. <b>That means your makefile
must know if it is being executed on Windows or Linux and only compile
the appropriate portions of the program as requested.</b>
<p>
The header file (list.h) contains
structure definitions and function prototypes, while the source
code files (.c) contain function definitions and variable
definitions. <b>Never define variables in header files. This causes
untold grief</b>. 
The test program is the only file that should have a main() function,
and it should call the list library routines to create, populate, and
manipulate the lists. As mentioned in the next section, we will
provide a simple sample test program to give you some clue as to the
kind of testing you could do for the library. Implement in stages,
putting the code for each type of list operation in the appropriate
source file. ListCurr() and ListCount() should go in list_movers.c.<br>
<p>
Since the list item is an arbitrary type, your library CANNOT KNOW how
to display it, how to search for it, or how to remove it. These details
must all be specified in your test program and communicated to your
library via function pointers. <b> All display debugging that shows
the details of an <tt>item</tt> must be located in the test program.</b>
<p>
Part of your mark will be determined by the rigorous nature of your
testing methodology.

<p>Note as well: Review the syntax for how to use a function as a parameter in C. This is
needed in ListFree and ListSearch.

<h3>Compiling and Testing</h3>
Your makefile will compile your list implementation
as a library archive (i.e <span style="font-weight: bold;">.a</span>
file). You must include, in your makefile, the commands to compile a
test program (to be provided by the marking script) as your application. The
file that the markers will use to do the list testing <b>IS</b> going
to be named <tt> testlist.c</tt>. <b>Unless otherwise specified</b>,
where the assignment requires test files and test results from you,
you are free to name the *executable* that executes your tests in any
reasonable way.
DO NOT hand in any source
file named <tt>testlist.c</tt>. If you do, our script will overwrite
that file and your testing will disappear.

<p>Mark Allocation. Marks will be allocated roughly equally between
implementation, and testing in the final phase hand-in. A small
portion of the marks will be allocated to proper use of git and
adequate construction of the makefile lines appropriate for each component.

<h4>OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT PORTION (20 marks)</h4>
<i>Memory Allocation Principles.</i>
In this version of the Part C, you are to implement the list memory
structure so that there are a variable number of list nodes and list
headers. This does not mean that you allocate them on-demand. You
shall have compile-time constants MIN_LISTS and MIN_NODES, which
specify the minimum amount of memory (array size) to allocate for each
of these data structures in ONE malloc for each data structure. If
obtaining a new node or a new list fails, you are to double the amount
of memory allocated for whichever resource has filled up (see the man
page for realloc()). If you determine that less than half the
allocated memory is being used for lists or nodes, you must divide the
amount of memory by 2 and copy the used nodes or lists into the new
space. Of course, you never go below MIN_LISTS or MIN_NODES. This is
the way Java implements arrays and vectors, and the way current
versions of the LINUX kernel handle the task_struct array.<br>


<h2>Part D: Xv6 User Program (pingpong) (20 marks - all in phase 3) - Borrowed
  from MIT </h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Write a program that uses UNIX system calls to ''ping-pong'' a
  byte between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each
  direction.
  The parent should send a byte to the child;
  the child should print "&lt;pid&gt;: received ping",
  where &lt;pid&gt; is its process ID,
  write the byte on the pipe to the parent,
  and exit;
  the parent should read the byte from the child,
  print "&lt;pid&gt;: received pong",
  and exit.
  Your
  solution should be in the file <tt>user/pingpong.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Use <tt>pipe</tt> to create a pipe.
    <li>Use <tt>fork</tt> to create a child.
    <li>Use <tt>read</tt> to read from the pipe, and <tt>write</tt> to write to the pipe.
    <li>Use <tt>getpid</tt> to find the process ID of the calling process.
    <li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.
    <li>User programs on xv6 have a limited set of library
    functions available to them. You can see the list in
    <tt>user/user.h</tt>; the source (other than for system calls)
    is in <tt>user/ulib.c</tt>, <tt>user/printf.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/umalloc.c</tt>.
  </ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell and it should produce the
  following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>pingpong</kbd>
    4: received ping
    3: received pong
    $
  </pre>
    <p>Your solution is correct if your program exchanges a byte
    between two processes and produces output as shown above.

<h2>Part D BONUS (20 marks): primes (borrowed from MIT)</h2>

    <p>Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.  This idea
    is due to Doug McIlroy, inventor of Unix pipes.  The picture
    halfway down <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/"> this page</a>
    and the surrounding text explain how to do it.  Your
    solution should be in the file <tt>user/primes.c</tt>.
</div>

    <p>Your goal is to use <tt>pipe</tt> and <tt>fork</tt> to set up
    the pipeline. The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35
    into the pipeline.  For each prime number, you will arrange to
    create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe
    and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. Since xv6 has
    limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first
    process can stop at 35.
    
<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Be careful to close file descriptors that a process does not
    need, because otherwise your program will run xv6 out of resources
    before the first process reaches 35.
      
    <li>Once the first process reaches 35, it should wait until the
    entire pipeline terminates, including all children, grandchildren,
    etc. Thus the main primes process should only exit after all the
    output has been printed, and after all the other primes processes
    have exited.

    <li>Hint: <tt>read</tt> returns zero when the write-side of
    a pipe is closed.

    <li>It's simplest to directly write 32-bit (4-byte) <tt>int</tt>s to the
        pipes, rather than using formatted ASCII I/O.

    <li>You should create the processes in the pipeline only as they are
      needed.

    <li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile.

  </ul>

<p>Your solution is correct if it implements a pipe-based
sieve and produces the following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>primes</kbd>
    prime 2
    prime 3
    prime 5
    prime 7
    prime 11
    prime 13
    prime 17
    prime 19
    prime 23
    prime 29
    prime 31
    $
  </pre>
    


<h2>Part E: Xv6 System Call (40 marks - all in phase 3) - Borrowed
  from MIT </h2>

<p> For this part of the assignment, you will download, configure and
compile a simple operating system kernel (xv6).

<p>
You will need to read parts of the kernel to understand
  its structure, and finally, you will make a small modification to
  the kernel.

<p>
Your task is to add a new system call to xv6. The main point of
the exercise is for you to see some of the different pieces of the
system call machinery.

</p><div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 2 of
    the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2022/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
    Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4, and
  related source files:

  </p><ul>



<p>In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that
  may help you when debugging later labs.  You'll create a
  new <tt>trace</tt> system call that will control tracing. It should
  take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which
  system calls to trace.  For example, to trace the fork system call,
  a program calls <tt>trace(1 &lt;&lt; SYS_fork)</tt>, where <tt>SYS_fork</tt> is a
  syscall number from <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. You have to modify
  the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to
  return, if the system call's number is set in the mask.
  The line should contain the
  process id, the name of the system call and the
  return value; you don't need to print the system call
  arguments. The <tt>trace</tt> system call should enable tracing
  for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks,
  but should not affect other processes.
</p>
<p>We provide a <tt>trace</tt> user-level program that runs another
  program with tracing enabled (see <tt>user/trace.c</tt>). When you're
  done, you should see output like this:

</p><pre>$ trace 32 grep hello README
3: syscall read -&gt; 1023
3: syscall read -&gt; 966
3: syscall read -&gt; 70
3: syscall read -&gt; 0
$
$ trace 2147483647 grep hello README
4: syscall trace -&gt; 0
4: syscall exec -&gt; 3
4: syscall open -&gt; 3
4: syscall read -&gt; 1023
4: syscall read -&gt; 966
4: syscall read -&gt; 70
4: syscall read -&gt; 0
4: syscall close -&gt; 0
$
$ grep hello README
$
$ trace 2 usertests forkforkfork
usertests starting
test forkforkfork: 407: syscall fork -&gt; 408
408: syscall fork -&gt; 409
409: syscall fork -&gt; 410
410: syscall fork -&gt; 411
409: syscall fork -&gt; 412
410: syscall fork -&gt; 413
409: syscall fork -&gt; 414
411: syscall fork -&gt; 415
...
$
</pre>



<p>
In order to make the new <tt>trace</tt> program available to run from
the xv6 shell, add <tt>_trace</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> definition
in <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>Some other tips:
<ul>
<li>
Find some other relatively simple xv6 system call, for
example the "uptime" system call, and look at how it is implemented.
</li>
<li>Add the right things into the proper default places for system
  calls: prototype in <tt>user/user.h</tt>, a stub
        to <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, and a syscall number
  to <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. Then it should compile.
</li>
<li>Add a <tt>sys_trace()</tt> function
in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> that implements the new system
call by remembering its argument in a new variable in
the <tt>proc</tt> structure (see <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt>). The
functions to retrieve system call arguments from user space are
in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>, and you can see examples
  of their use in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
</li>
<li>Modify <tt>fork()</tt> to copy the trace maes from the parent to
  the child process</li>
<li>Modify <tt>syscall()</tt> to print the trace output. You will need to add an array of syscall names to index into.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Part F: Programming Style Guide (10 marks - phase 1) </h2>

<p>
Submit a .txt file (called 332-style-guidelines-teamxx.txt) providing
the style guidelines you will follow between you and your partner that
provide more specific restrictions than those that have already been
given as requirements for CMPT 332.
</p>



<br>
<h2> Hand In Instructions</h2>

NOTE: All files must be UNIX text files. That is where the
marking is going to take place for the most part, and it is very
annoying for the marker to have to examine code with extraneous
characters messing things up. As well, the Mac filesystem creates
._files for many of the files that get modified. <b>If you use a Mac,
please remove all of these files. There must be no lines longer than
80 characters. If you write on Windows, make sure you use a program to
convert the text file to a UNIX file (man dos2unix, use a 'tr' command
to get rid of the unwanted characters, or better yet, just do not write
documentation in Windows for this course).</b>

<p>
<b>Phase 1 deliverables</b> (25 marks: 5 for part A, 5 for part B, 5 for
part C, and 10 for part F): <br>
<ul>
  <li>design documentation for Part A and Part C. These should be 2
UNIX text files named PartA.design.txt and PartC.design.txt. This
should describe your design decisions and ideas of how to progress with
the rest of the assignment.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Completed shell script for Part B. Your shell script shall be named
  <strong>partB.bash</strong>. 
  </li>
  <li>Skeleton programs that have all the procedures and the interface
  between the modules for both Parts A.1 and C. No part of the programs
  need to do anything functional except <b>check that the correct type 
and range of parameter values, as appropriate</b> have been passed 
between caller and callee and   <b>printout the following statement</b> "Got
  to procedure X"</b>, where  X is the name of the procedure
  executing, or "Error in procedure X: invalid parameter Y", if the
  interface rules have been broken by the caller. This is done by
  having the main() program call every function and having the
  function check for error conditions and return appropriate error
  values.</li>

  <li>Makefile that compiles Part A.1 and Part C. 
   For Part C, you must make a library 
   named <strong>liblist.a</strong>, and supply a test program called 
   <strong>mytestlist.c </strong> and lines in the makefile
   to create an executable called <strong>mytestlist</strong> for your
   testing program. For Phase 3, we will use our own test program to
   verify the functionality of your assignment.</li> 

Take care to ensure that you do not try and compile Linux code on Windows
nor Windows code on Linux. This can be done by <b>if-statements</b> in
  the makefile. 
  <li>Programming Style Guide</li>
  <li>GIT log. Logs of the commits done. There should be commits done
  by both partners.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Phase 2 deliverables</b> (20 marks: 10 for part A, and 10 for part C):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Updated design documentation.
  <li>Test plan for all of Part A and Part C. These should be 2 UNIX
text files named <tt>PartA.testplan.txt</tt> and
<tt>PartC.testplan.txt</tt>.</li> 
  <li>Working prototype program</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For Part A, you must have Part A.1 working correctly.
For Part A.2, A.3 and Bonus parts, have commands that compile a dummy pthreads 
and Posix threads program, and Process versions respectively, 
if you are doing the bonus.  
Nothing has to compute correctly 
for these remaining parts.  This explicitly includes creating threads, but
the threads do not have to do anything, except call Square one time.
</li>
    <li>For Part B, hand the script in again. There are no marks
    allocated for it in this phase, but hand it in, so we can test
    your parts A.1 and A.2.
    <li>For Part C, you <b>must</b> implement adding nodes to lists, 
and <b>should</b> have the
increasing of memory size if memory fills up (if you are doing the extra
credit).<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Test results for features implemented. These are to be in
  <tt>PartA.testresults.txt</tt> and <tt>PartC.testresults.txt</tt>.</li>
  <li>Makefile to allow the marking script to compile your code.
  <li>Git log<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Phase 3 deliverables</b> (175 marks: 40 for part A, 5 for Part B, 70
for part C, and 20 for Part D, 40 for Part E- 10 marks taken for git and
make from appropriate parts):

<p> 
For parts A, B, and C, hand in the following:<ul>
  <li>Updated Design documentation (Part[ABC].design.txt)</li>
  <li>Working source code for all subparts</li>
  <li>Final test plan for all subparts</li>
  <li>Test results for all subparts</li>
  <li>Final versions of Makefile that compiles Windows executables on
  Windows and Linux executables on Linux. The makefile should <b>only
  compile the list library for Linux</b> and you shall name your executables
<b>mytestlist-Linuxx86_64</b> and <b>testlist-Linuxx86_64</b>, 
respectively for your testing and
the marker-supplied test file. <br>
</li>
  <li>GIT log.</li>
</ul>

For Parts D and E, hand in the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Design document: PartD.design.txt and PartE.design.txt
<li> source code for pingpong user program
<li> Diff file of the changes you made
<li> Test plan and test results for the pingpong program (PartD.testing.txt)
<li> tar of the source files only (including makefile) of the xv6-riscv
  directory named explicitly xv6-A1.tar (this can be done with a "make clean"
  and then tar).
<li> test results of your tracing and instructions for how the marker
  can reproduce them (PartE.testing.txt).
<li> GIT logs of the work done by <b>both</b> partners
</ul>

For Part E, hand in the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li> GIT logs of the work done by <b>both</b> partners
</ul>



Bonus features document. Bonus marks (10 marks) will be given for
identifying what features you think could be added next to either Part
A or Part C.


Bonus Implementation: More bonus (10 marks) will be given if successful
implementation of these bonus features is achieved.<br>

Bonus xv6 (20 marks): Implementation of the sieves program and 
appropriate testing (10 marks each).  PartD-bonus.testing.txt.

<h3>For each phase</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a directory for this assignment (e.g. <tt>a1-phase1</tt>).</li>
  <li> Place in this directory your assignment including the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> your <span style="font-weight: bold;">source</span> files</li>
    <li> any separate <span style="font-weight: bold;">documentation</span>
files. For this assignment, design documentation, a test plan, testing
verification and other documents as
required for each phase.&nbsp;<br>
    </li>
    <li> a <span style="font-weight: bold;">makefile</span> that
compiles the executable files required for this assignment.</li>
    <li>git log showing the development history for the assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> The following must NOT be in the directory:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> any .o files or any executable files</li>
    <li> any files having nothing to do with this assignment</li>
    <li> any subdirectories, especially not the entire contents of
    your Git repository.</li>
  </ul>
  <i>Any failure to meet these requirements will result in a grade of
  0.</i> We just do not have the time in the budget to repair your assignments
  so that they will properly compile with the marking scripts that we
  have developed. <br>
  ALL FILES MUST BE IN THE ROOT OF THE
  DIRECTORY THAT IS TAR-ED. YOUR xv6 TAR FILE WILL EXPAND INTO A
  HIERARCHY AS IN THE ORIGINAL, BUT THE TAR FILE MUST BE IN THE
  ROOT.

  <br> As an example, the output of <tt>tar -tvf myfile.tar</tt>
  should be similar to

  <tt>xv6-riscv</tt>. No fs.img file, no .o files.


  <li> Now you are ready to hand in your assignment. To do so you are
going to make a <span style="font-weight: bold;">tar</span> file from
within the directory that you have placed all your files, and upload
    it to the Canvas assignment hand-in. The TA will then untar the
assignment and then run&nbsp; '<span style="font-weight:
bold;">make</span>'&nbsp; 
on your set of files to generate the executable files to evaluate your
assignment. Please do not gzip the file, or use any other types of
    compression. I havee had problems with different students using
    different versions of the compression program and it just takes
    too much TA time. Do not use <tt>zip</tt> and then rename the
    file to a <tt>.tar</tt> file. We say this because people have
    done it before.</li>
  <li>Hand in only one complete solution per team.</li>
  <li> That's it - you are done.</li>
