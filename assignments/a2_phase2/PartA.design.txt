XV6 part A design

Threading:

uthread_switch.S:
thread_switch: 
    it accepts 2 parameters, a pointer to a current thread,and a pointer to 
    the thread to switch to.
    this function performs context switch by storing the thread switching in 
    a struct and loading new. i checked the two .S files from kernel directory
    i copied the code from swtch.S from kernel directory to thread_switch.
    the purpose of swtch.S is the same as thread_switch().

thread_create(void (*tmain)()):

    in the code i used the coding design as already inside the code, 
    like "printf("thread_schedule: no runnable threads\n"); exit(-1);"

thread_schedule:
    switched between threads by calling thread_switch() from uthread_switch.S
    switches from current to next thread to run.
